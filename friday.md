## An Overview of the Python code Tool Lanscape 2023 ([link](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/110/))

- Canceled `:(`

## Dev containers

- Microsoft advocate talking about [dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
- Mostly a marketing ad for Microsoft tech
- I am sad original talk got canceled

Not worth anyone's time

## Making CPython 3.11 Especially Fast

- "Just upgrade to 3.11 and you'll probably see a performance improvement"
- Cool talk on the "how" of making python 3.11 faster
- It's all under the hood -- no changes by the user required, outside of writing good python from the start
- Presenter created package to show people where their python code was being optimized, see [Specialist](https://pypi.org/project/specialist/)
- More info on this in [PEP659](https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/)

Cool talk. Worth watching if you're into Python internals.
