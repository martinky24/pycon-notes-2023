## Keynote - James Powell

Awesome talk. Tries to really dig into understanding "what does being a python expert get you", and talks through some of the reasons it might not be worth everyone's time.

## Python Linters at Scale ([link](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/101/))

## How Pydantic V2 leverages Rust's Superpowers ([link](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/39/))

## Subclassing, Composition, Python, and You ([link](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/7/))

Didn't go to this talk, but I really wanted to. Need to watch the recording.
