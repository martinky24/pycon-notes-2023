## Getting Around the GIL: Parallelizing Python for Better Performance ([link](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/talks/))

VERY basics of concurrency. Not that interesting or useful, basic tutorials online will be more to the point and useful

## Rest

Didn't catch anything else due to flight out of town.
